>The idea was to cover the bike in a tarp and set off a system to deter the theif when the tarp was taken off without authorization.

### THE START!
The first system of the series, **Kat Guard**, is meant to protect your bike by brining attention to the theft using a tarp.

The tarp was chosen because it acts as a extra layer of sercuity to deter theifs from trying to steal the bike as well as providing protection from seviomental factors. It walso provides us with several option to detect when the bike is being tampered with without authorization.

**Detection Method**
* Light Sensor
* Magnets
* Conductivity

We decided to go with a light sensor because it was easiest to implament and also effective at determening wether the tarp was removed or not.

>[!Problem]
>Due to the varying amounts of light that may be in the enviorment, the tarp must block 100% of the light from the outside.

**Authorization Method**
* NFC
* Bluetooth
* Key
* Magnet

For the first prototype, we decided to use a key system because that was what we had in hand. In the future, a NFC card would be the preferable method of authentication because it enables the user to interface with the device from longer distances. Addtionally, an added benefit to using NFC comes from the NFC keys, which come in a variety of compact form factors such as stickers which can be put onto every day carry items such as your phone making it more convinient.
